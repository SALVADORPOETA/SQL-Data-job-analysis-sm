This query isolates the highest-paying Data Analyst positions that offer full remote flexibility (“Anywhere”) 
and have a published annual salary. By joining job postings with company information, 
it provides a consolidated view of compensation, employer identity, job structure, and posting timelines.

The result represents a small but strategically important subset of the dataset: 
the top 10 best-paid remote roles. These roles reflect the upper end of the Data Analyst market, 
typically associated with highly specialized skills, senior responsibilities, 
or companies operating in competitive tech-driven industries.

at or above market averages to secure top performers.

The output enables downstream analysis such as skill requirements, industry sector comparisons, employer patterns, 
and temporal trends in high-value analytics hiring. 
In essence, the query provides a curated snapshot of the elite tier of Data Analyst opportunities, 
capturing the market’s most competitive compensation benchmarks for remote analytical talent.
